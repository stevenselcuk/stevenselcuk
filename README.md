I am <i>le développeur</i> who's focused on trying to digitalize General Aviation cockpits and MRO hangars. Mostly working on iOS & macOS project with Swift but yeah somedays, if I slept well, I like JavaScript (like NodeJS backend & React & React Native). It's just ok. I am an aviation 🛩 consultant too. and indie Filmmaker 🎥 (yes, I have short films and a documentary project now) and home-chef 🔪.  Well. That's it I guess.
