	<h1>Henlo fren 👋 It's Steven 😏</h1>

<br>

I am <i>le développeur</i>, focused on creating electronic flight bag apps for pilots, airlines, air charters, and MROs. Most of the time, I work on iOS & macOS projects with Swift / SwiftUI, but some days, if I sleep well, I do some JavaScript work like React & Node.js. Besides the building APIs, I am an aviation consultant, indie Filmmaker 🎥, and home chef 🔪. Well. That's it, I guess.

And also 👇🏻

💼 I am the deputy graveyard shift manager at [🐈 Tabby Cat](https://tabbythecat.com)
